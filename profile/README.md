## What Is Expats Thriving in Europe Plus? A Quick Rundown

### The Program in a Nutshell

*Expats Thriving in Europe Plus* is a 12-month, white-glove relocation service designed for ambitious Americans ready to live in Europe for at least five years.

### Who’s Behind It?

The brainchild of Michelle Garabito, founder of The Lux Nomads, this program leans on her experience as a Forbes-featured digital nomad and entrepreneur. She’s built a reputation helping Americans ditch the 9-to-5 grind for location independence, and this is her flagship offering. But does her expertise justify the price? We’ll get there.

## My First Impressions: The Promise vs. The Price

When I landed on [The Whop page](https://whop.com/expats-thriving-in-europe-plus/?a=kelechienwere1234), the pitch hit me hard: “Live Like a European for 5 Years.” It’s bold, aspirational, and taps right into my daydreams of cobblestone streets and croissants. The promise of “top-tier visa, tax, and relocation support” sounded like a lifeline for someone like me who’s fumbled through paperwork before.

But then I saw the cost: $6,500 a month for 12 months, plus a $7,000 upfront fee. That’s $85,000 total. My jaw dropped. I’ve hired lawyers for less! Still, I kept an open mind—premium services often come with premium price tags. I needed to know what I’d get for that investment.

## Breaking Down the Features: What You’re Paying For

Let’s unpack this like a suitcase fresh off the plane. Here’s what *Expats Thriving in Europe Plus* offers:

### 1. Visa and Tax Support

- **What It Includes**: Full assistance with visa applications and tax planning to keep you legal in Europe.
- **Why It Matters**: Navigating EU bureaucracy is a nightmare—I once spent weeks decoding Portuguese residency rules. Having experts handle this could save months of stress.

### 2. Housing and Relocation Guidance

- **What It Includes**: Help finding a home and settling into your new European life.
- **My Take**: As someone who’s rented sketchy apartments sight-unseen, this perk feels golden. But how personalized is it? The site doesn’t say.

### 3. Exclusive Community Access

- **What It Includes**: Real-time chat with 101+ members, plus local insights from fellow expats.
- **Why It’s Cool**: Moving abroad can be lonely. A built-in network might ease that homesickness I felt in my first expat stint.

### 4. A 12-Month Structured Program

- **What It Includes**: A year-long roadmap to ensure long-term success, with support extending to five years.
- **The Hook**: This isn’t a quick fix—it’s a commitment to thriving, not just surviving.

### 5. Fun Extras

## The Cost Breakdown: $85,000 Under the Microscope

Here’s the math:

- **Initial Fee**: $7,000 (one-time)
- **Monthly Fee**: $6,500 x 12 = $78,000
- **Total**: $85,000

For context, I’ve moved to Europe before for under $10,000, including flights and a lawyer. So, $85,000 feels steep. But this isn’t DIY—it’s a concierge experience. Let’s compare:

| **Service**            | **DIY Cost** | **Expats Thriving Cost** | **Value Added**           |
|------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Visa Assistance        | $2,000       | Included                 | Expert hand-holding       |
| Tax Planning           | $1,500       | Included                 | Stress-free compliance    |
| Housing Help           | $500         | Included                 | Time saved                |
| Community Access       | Free (forums)| Included                 | Exclusive networking      |
| 5-Year Support         | N/A          | Included                 | Long-term peace of mind   |

*Expats Thriving in Europe Plus costs $85,000 for a 12-month program, including visa help, tax support, and housing guidance, with benefits lasting five years.*

## Who’s This For? My Take on the Ideal Member

This program isn’t for everyone. It’s built for:

- **Remote Workers**: You need a job to join (FAQ confirms it). No job, no dice.
- **High Earners**: $85,000 demands serious income—think six-figure remote gigs.
- **Dream Chasers**: If you’re set on a European life and hate logistics, this is your jam.

I fit the remote worker mold, but my budget balked. If I’d had this option during my chaotic move to Spain years ago, I might’ve jumped—assuming I could afford it.

## Michelle Garabito: The Woman Behind the Curtain

Michelle’s the heart of this program, and her creds caught my eye. Forbes-featured? Check. Digital nomad guru? Check. But digging deeper, I hit a wall. Her online footprint is thin—joining Whop in November 2024 suggests this is fresh territory. No testimonials or case studies yet, which gave me pause.

Still, her Lux Nomads brand promises expertise. I’d love to hear from someone she’s helped—until then, her Forbes nod is the trust anchor.

## Pros and Cons: The Good, the Bad, and the Pricey

### Pros

- **All-in-One Solution**: Visas, taxes, housing—done. No more juggling providers.
- **Community Vibe**: Networking with expats could spark friendships or business ideas.
- **Long-Term Focus**: Five years of support beats the one-off consultancies I’ve tried.

### Cons

- **Cost Shock**: $85,000 could fund a small house in Portugal!

## How It Stacks Up: Alternatives I’ve Explored

I’ve tried other routes—here’s how they compare:

1. **DIY Relocation**
   - **Cost**: $5,000–$10,000
   - **Pros**: Cheap, flexible
   - **Cons**: Time-consuming, error-prone (I lost $1,000 to a visa mistake once)

2. **Expat Consultancies (e.g., Expatsi)**
   - **Cost**: $1,000–$5,000
   - **Pros**: Affordable expertise
   - **Cons**: Limited scope, no community

3. **Expats Thriving in Europe Plus**
   - **Cost**: $85,000
   - **Pros**: Comprehensive, long-term
   - **Cons**: Wallet-draining

For me, DIY worked because I’m stubborn. But if I had cash to burn, this program’s depth might tempt me.

## My Experience with the Whop Platform

Whop’s the backbone here, so I checked it out. It’s slick—think Etsy for digital services. Reviews on Trustpilot give it 4 stars (938 users as of April 2025), praising support but flagging occasional seller scams. For *Expats Thriving*, the platform feels legit, but the lack of program-specific reviews is a gap.

**Tip**: Visit [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/whop.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/whop.com) for Whop’s vibe.

## Is It Worth It? My Honest Verdict

Here’s where I land: *Expats Thriving in Europe Plus* is a dream-maker for the right person. If you’re a high-earning remote pro who’d rather pay for peace of mind than wrestle with red tape, it’s intriguing. The five-year promise and community angle set it apart—I wish I’d had that when I landed in Europe jet-lagged and clueless.

But $85,000? That’s a car, a down payment, or a year of travel. With no reviews and a new creator, it’s a leap of faith. I’d feel better with testimonials or a cheaper trial tier. For now, I’d hold off unless my bank account begged me to splurge.
